## Information
### Database
[ag_news]([https://huggingface.co/datasets/glue](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ag_news)

This database uses a text with label format, with each label being an integer between 0 and 3, relating to the 4 main categories of the news:  World (0), Sports (1), Business (2), Sci/Tech (3).

I chose this one because of the larger variety of categories compared to sentiment databases, with the themes/categories theoretically being more closely related to analogies. I also chose ag_news because, as a news source, it should avoid slang and other potential hiccups that databases using tweets or general reviews will have.

### Pre-trained model
[sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

Because my focus is on using embeddings to evaluate analogies for the AnalogyArcade, I focused my model search for those in the sentence-transformers category, as they are readily made for embedding usage. I chose all-MiniLM-L6-v2 because of its high usage and good reviews: it is a well trained model but smaller and more efficient than its previous version.
